<h2>Salary_Prediction_Using_Simple_Linear_Regression</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
In todayâ€™s competitive job market, setting fair, competitive salaries is essential for attracting and retaining talent. A machine learning model that predicts salaries based on years of experience provides HR teams with data-driven insights to make informed compensation decisions. This project aims to build an accurate, interpretable model that streamlines the salary-setting process, ensuring consistency and fairness across the organization.

<h3>Dataset</h3>
Salary data with respect to the number of years of experience in the company.

<h4>A data of 36 employees with labels:</h4>
<li>First Column of the data is the number of years of experience 
<li>Second Column is the Salary of the Employees
<h4>Defining the data labels: </h4>
<li> Independent Variable: Independent variable is the variable that is manipulated or changed to observe how it affects another variable.<br>
 [Here the independent variable will be the number of years of experience.]
<li> Dependent Variable: The Dependent variable is the variable being tested and measured, and it is expected to change as a result of changes in the independent variable.
 [Here the dependent variable will be the Salary.]
